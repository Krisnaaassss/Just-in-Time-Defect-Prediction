# Empirical Study of Just-In-Time Defect Prediction

This repository is an adapted replication package based on Hugo Liang's EmS-JIT-DP project, with additional Windows setup and smoke-test scripts.

Replication package for the paper entitled: Revisiting Pre-trained Models and Feature Fusion Strategies for Just-In-Time Defect Prediction

### Data Preparation
The `Original` and `Unified` datasets can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1l9eNwnOje7fOX-dmb0Gh1jH9TfQkVlia?usp=drive_link). Download `*.tar.gz` and extract it under the `Dataset/fine-tuning/JITDefectPrediction/` folder via `tar -zxvf *.tar.gz`.


### Pretrained model files Preparation
Manually download the **added_tokens.json, config.json, merges.txt, pytorch_model.bin, special_tokens_map.json, tokenizer_config.json, and vocab.json** from [Hugging Face-CodeT5](https://huggingface.co/Salesforce/codet5-base/tree/main), upload them to **models/codet5_base/**.


### Environment Settings
* GPU: Nvidia Tesla P40
* OS: CentOS 7.6

```
git clone https://github.com/Hugo-Liang/EmS-JIT-DP.git
cd EmS-JIT-DP
conda create -n EmS python=3.8
conda activate EmS
pip install torch==2.0.0+cu117 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run
#### 1. CodeT5+RF: CodeT5 with random forest

+ 1.1 CodeT5 with semantic feature

```
bash scripts/finetune_jitdp_SF.sh -g 0
```

+ 1.2. Random Forest with expert features

```
python RF.py
```

+ 1.3. Average prediction results from CodeT5 and Random Forest

```
python combine.py
```


#### 2. CodeT5+EF: CodeT5 with concatenated embeddings

+ CodeT5 with semantic feature and expert features

```
bash scripts/finetune_jitdp_SF_EF.sh -g 0
```
